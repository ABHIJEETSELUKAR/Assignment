    "Q1 Answer => \n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects and their interactions to solve problems. In OOP, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data. The data members of a class are variables, and the functions are called methods. The class defines the behavior of the objects created from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a real-world entity that has a set of properties (attributes) and can perform certain actions (methods). An object is an instance of a class, meaning it is created using the class as a template. The properties of an object are determined by the class it belongs to, but the values of those properties are specific to that particular object."

    "Q2 Ans => The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This refers to the technique of hiding the internal workings of an object from the outside world and only exposing a public interface to interact with it. It helps in achieving better data security and reducing code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This is the process of creating a new class from an existing class, where the new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class. This helps in code reuse and saves time and effort in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of an object to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which it is used. In OOP, this is usually achieved through method overloading or method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: This refers to the ability to focus on the essential features of an object and ignore the rest. It is a technique used to manage complexity by simplifying the representation of an object and only showing the necessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars are fundamental concepts of OOP and are used to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable software systems."
